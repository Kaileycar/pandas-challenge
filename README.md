# Background
I am the new Chief Data Scientist for my city's school district. I will be using my data I found to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions reguarding future school budgeting and priorities. This assignment requires us to analyze teo different data sets on two separate csv files. One file contains district-wide statardized testing reults and the other one contains schools and type of school. My first task was to combine the two csv files into one dataset in order for me to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Complete these scripts in Jupyter Notebook and push to my repository.

# Output:
I first started out by cloning my repository to my terminal and making a resources folder to store the csv files in. After that I opened up Jupyter Notebook to start on my assignment. I used the 'PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb' to get a layout idea. Throughout the Module 4 challenge I had created 9 separate DataFrames to showcase data from each section.

# Sections
District Summary
School Summary
Highest Performing Schools by Percentage of Overall Passing
Lowest Performing Schools by Percentage of Overall Passing
Math Scores by Grade
Reading Scores by Grade
Scores by School Spending
Scores by School Size
Scores by School Type

At the end of completing all my DataFrames, I had to write an analysis on the trends that I saw that would help determine how schools would budget/prioritize in the future years. 

# Files
schools_complete.csv
students_complete.csv
